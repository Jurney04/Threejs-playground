# 🧠 Three.js Playground

A collection of small 3D experiments and demos built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Vite**.  
This is my personal sandbox for learning and testing creative web-3D ideas — from simple shapes and animations to more complex interactive scenes.

---

## 🚧 Project Status
> **Currently in development** — I’m actively adding new experiments, refining components, and trying out new Three.js concepts.

## 🧩 Overview
This project is structured as a React app containing multiple Three.js demos.  
Each experiment explores a specific feature or concept in 3D graphics — such as lighting, materials, motion, and camera movement.

| Demo | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Circles | Basic use of circle that are animated the turn around eachother |
| Angel | Custom Angel where the use of textures and materials is used |
| FullAngel | This is a extra step above Angel, where i added volumetric cloud and lighting |
| MachineRoom| This is a proceduraly generating hallway with gears and pipes |
